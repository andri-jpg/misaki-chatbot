# Misaki Live2D AI Chatbot



https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a3430e2-23c5-48c2-92fb-0a334af33887


This project brings the character Misaki from the game *Blue Archive* to life as an interactive AI chatbot. It combines a Spine WebGL Live2D model with a Python backend for AI-powered conversation and real-time Text-to-Speech (TTS) voice generation.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Interactive Live2D Model:** Misaki's model is rendered in the browser using Spine WebGL, allowing for smooth animations and interactions.
* **AI Chat Integration:** Engage in conversation powered by the Google Gemini API.
* **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Hear Misaki's responses with a synthesized voice generated by the GPT-SoVITS model.
* **Simple Web Interface:** A clean and straightforward UI for chatting and triggering animations.

## üöß Known Issues & Future Improvements

This project is currently in active development. While functional, there are several areas that require improvement. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!

* **Bug Fixes:** There are various known bugs that can affect stability and user experience. General code refactoring and debugging are ongoing.

* **Animation Smoothness:** Transitions between animations (e.g., from talking to idle, or reacting to user input) can sometimes be abrupt. The goal is to improve animation blending for a more natural and fluid feel.

* **Phoneme Lip Sync:** This is a high-priority feature. Currently, the mouth animation for talking is generic. The plan is to implement a system that analyzes the generated TTS audio in real-time to produce accurate mouth movements (visemes/phonemes) that sync with the sound.

## üöÄ How to Run

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### 1. Prerequisites & Configuration

This project uses the Google Gemini API to power the chat functionality. You will need an API key to proceed.

* **Get a Gemini API Key:** Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) to create your free API key.

* **Add Your API Key:** Open the `config.js` file and add your Gemini API key in the following format:
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
    Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` with the actual key you obtained from Google AI Studio.

### 2. Backend Setup

Next, set up and run the Python server.

* **Install Dependencies:** Open your terminal in the project folder and install the required Python packages from `requirements.txt`. 
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
* **Run the API:** Start the server. 
    ```bash
    python api_v2.py
    ```
    The server should now be running and ready to handle chat requests.

### 3. Frontend Setup

* **Open the HTML File:** Make sure you are running a local web server (like the one included with Laragon, VS Code Live Server, or `python -m http.server`). Then, open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

You should now be able to interact with the Misaki chatbot.
